# flask-waitercaller

The application allows multiple, unrelated restaurants to use the same app. When the customer wants waiter attention,
they follow a short link or scan the QR-code which is relevat to their table, using their smartphones.
The waiter should see a notification appered on the centrilize screen. The waiter then will acknowledge the notification
on the screen and attend to the client.

The setup required for the application is as follows:
- The restaurant manager signs up a new account on the web application
- The restaurant manager provides basic information about how many tables the restaurant has
- The web application provides a unique URL and a QR-code for each table 
- The restaurant manager prints out these URLs/QR-codes and ensures that the relevant URL/QR-code is easily accessible
  from each table
